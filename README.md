# Dragon Tyrant
A Choose Your Own Adventure-style virtual gamebook about finding a way to slay a seemingly invincible dragon.

The name "Dragon Tyrant," as well as several narrative elements were heavily inspired by Nick Bostrom's "Fable of the Dragon Tyrant," which you can read here: https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html
